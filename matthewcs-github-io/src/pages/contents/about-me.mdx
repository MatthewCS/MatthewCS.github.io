Hello! My name is Matthew, and I'm a Computer Science major from Syracuse, NY.
I'm currently in my senior year at Clarkson University. There's a lot of topics
that I'm interested in, so here's an incomplete list:

- Full-stack web development
  - I'm a huge fan of React, which is what this page was made with.
- Database development
  - I'm familiar with SQL as well as MongoDB.
- Machine learning
  - To be specific, I think that image understanding is a really exciting field!
- Etc.
  - I also like picking up new projects and learning new, miscellaneous skills.

I've been interested in computers and computer programming since I was learning
to walk. My dad worked IT, and he would always come home to work on some sort of
hobby project. Watching him work and playing with his projects was always fun, and
I started to learn Python when I got to High School. The rest is history.
