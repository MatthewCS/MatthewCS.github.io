Hello! My name is Matthew, and I'm a Computer Science major from Syracuse, NY.
I'm a recent graduate (December '23) of Clarkson University.
There are a lot of topics that I'm interested in, so here's a few:

- Full-stack web development
  - I'm a huge fan of React, which is what this page was made with.
- Database development
  - I'm familiar with SQL as well as MongoDB.
- Open-source software
  - Open-source code makes pages like this one possible!
- Etc.
  - I also like picking up new projects and learning new, miscellaneous skills.

I've been interested in computers and computer programming since I was a kid.
My dad was an IT worker, and he would always come home and write one of his many
hobby projects. Watching him work and playing with his projects was always fun,
so I started to learn Python when I got to High School. The rest is history.
