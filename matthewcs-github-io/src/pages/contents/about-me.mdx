# About me
Hello! My name is Matthew, and I'm a Computer Science major from Syracuse, NY.
I'm currently in my senior year at Clarkson University. There's a lot of topics
that I'm interested in, so here's an incomplete list:
  - Database development
    - I'm familiar with MySQL as well as MongoDB. I actually don't have a strong preference either way.
  - Full-stack web development
    - I'm a huge fan of React, which is what this page was made with.
  - Machine learning
    - To be more specific, I think that image understanding is a really exciting field!
  - Etc.
    - I also like picking up new projects and learning new, miscellaneous skills.

Expect more to be added to this page soon!
